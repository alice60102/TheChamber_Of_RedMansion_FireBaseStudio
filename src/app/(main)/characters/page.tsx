/**
 * @fileOverview Characters Page - Feature Removed
 * 
 * This page was originally designed to display character information and relationship maps
 * for the Dream of the Red Chamber novel. The feature included interactive character
 * profiles, relationship visualizations, and detailed character analysis.
 * 
 * Status: REMOVED
 * The "學習狀況" (Learning Analysis) feature has been removed from the application
 * as per user request. This may have been due to scope reduction, performance
 * considerations, or prioritization of core reading features.
 * 
 * Original intended functionality:
 * - Character profiles with biographical information
 * - Interactive relationship maps showing character connections
 * - Character appearance tracking throughout chapters
 * - AI-powered character analysis and insights
 * - Visual representations of family trees and social hierarchies
 * 
 * If this feature needs to be restored in the future, consider implementing:
 * - Dynamic character data loading from structured content
 * - Interactive network graphs for relationship visualization
 * - Character search and filtering capabilities
 * - Integration with the knowledge graph component
 * - Character-specific reading progress tracking
