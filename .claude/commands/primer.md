# Prime Context for Claude Code

Use the command `tree` to get an understanding of the current root project folder structure.

Start with reading the `CLAUDE.md` file if it exists to get an understanding of the project.

Read the current root project folder README.md file to get an understanding of the project.

Read key files in `streamlit_pipeline` of directory.

And please run this command to wake up the `serena` mcp sever in background : `uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena start-mcp-server --transport sse
  --enable-web-dashboard true --context ide-assistant` with openning local web dashboard.

**IMPORTANT : Then, when the Serena mcp sever connected, Use Serena to search through the current root project codebase. If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.**

Explain back to me (Based on current root project folder):
- Project structure
- Project purpose and goals
- Key files and their purposes
- Any important dependencies
- Any important configuration files
